# Project-ColdFront-v1.0
Project ColdFront is a Project I have been working on, it will be a interactive disambler for nova's usermode anti-cheat called "FGuard"  

It works by hijacks nova's thread for FGuard to access data from it like exports, encryption, server packets, and more. The user can select options and more from a interactive display window that is overlayed from hijacked WDM's (Window Desktop Manager) Notification Overlayer. It will have configs, debug information, output logs and more..  

Open-source, pre-compiled release will be in releases to the right! IN BETA!!  

Releasingn more infortmation on it, on release..
