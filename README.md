# Project-ColdFront-v1.0
Stopped working on the project but more work will be put in later.

Project ColdFront is a Project I have been working on, it will be a interactive disambler for nova's usermode anti-cheat called "FGuard"  

It works by hijacking nova's thread for FGuard, to access data from it like exports, encryption, server packets, and more. The user can select options and more from a interactive display window that can be toggled with F5, output logs and more..  

Check releases for most recent update and pre-compiled release! 
More information gets released in my discord server about FGuard and updates!
